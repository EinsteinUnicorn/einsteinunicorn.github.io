        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Becky Button. I'm a maker and a graduate of the Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon University.
            I have over 10 years of experience building projects with microncontrollers, 3D printers and various other emerging technologies. 
            Like many other people, I enjoy doing things that are both fun to do, and sometimes useful for other people. 
            So far that that venture has taken me to the world of small scale manufacturing, assistive technology, semiconductor fabrication, musical 
            effects and probably a few other things I'm forgetting. Please check out some of my projects below, and if you would like to connect, please 
            reach out to me at beckybutton@proton.me. I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and help others on projects.

                <h3>HackerFab Details</h3>
                <p>During my time at the HackerFab, I worked to go through pieces of the process, which included
                    testing our Spin On Glass process, testing the electrical properties of the traces, and using
                    spectroscopy methods to determine how thick the spin on glass was. I designed 3D printed spectrometer 
                    mounts for both the microscope and the plasma etcher.

                <p>While doing a residency at Petersburg Art Space Berlin, I developed a foot shaped effects pedal. 
                    Winny Li developed the graphic design for the pedal. I had several workshops across Germany, included at the FSCK hacker camp
                and with people I met at Superbooth. Aisler sponsored the PCB's for the workshops.</p>

                <p> I designed the mechanical parts of our webconnected braille embosser. 
                    Did a focus group with blind users to verify the design was actually useful for the people we intended to use it.
                    Added textures on the surfaces to ensure peole would know how to orient the paper.

                <p> As more and more devices were getting connected to the internet, I thought it was important to 
                    make sure people knew to update their endpoints for security purposes. This was a fun way to show 
                    how not doing so was suseptible to security exploits. I publi
